== News

* September 11, 2009 - Last code changes were from December, then life
got in the way! I just rolled together a 0.0.4 source tarball.

== Purpose

image::images/starwars.png[starwars,width=320, title="'Star Wars' by Atari, 1983"]



The purpose of `libcrtxy` is to provide an easy way to create
vector-graphics-basic games, similar to arcade games of the late 1970s
and early 1980s, such as *Star Wars*
(http://klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9773[KLOV] |
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(1983_video_game)[Wikipedia]),
*Battlezone* (http://klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7059[KLOV] |
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlezone_(1980_video_game)[Wikipedia]),
*Lunar Lander* (http://klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=8465[KLOV] |
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(arcade_game)[Wikipedia]),
*Asteroids* (http://klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=6939[KLOV] |
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)[Wikipedia]),
*Tempest* (http://www.klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10065[KLOV] |
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(arcade_game)[Wikipedia]), and, of
course, *Space Wars* (http://klov.com/game_detail.php?game_id=9691[KLOV]
| http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Wars[Wikipedia]).

== What's the Point?

Some of my first games for modern systems (X-Window on Solaris in the
late 1990s) were 3D games drawn using vector outlines (e.g.,
http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/icbm3d/[ICBM3D]). One of my games,
http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/vectoroids/[Vectoroids], has been ported
to many platforms, including mobile devices and handheld game systems.
This is no doubt because it's scalable (thanks to vector graphics),
doesn't require much horsepower (it uses fixed-point math and
trigonometric look-up tables), and is written atop a highly portable
library (libSDL).

I have a number of years experience doing cellphone game development on
`BREW` and `J2ME`. The games that were easiest to port were some
classic-arcade-style vector games, for the same reasons Vectoroids has
been ported so often.

While doing mobile game development, one learns that there are many
screen sizes to deal with, many CPU speeds to deal with, and therefore
it's easiest to think of your game in a virtual canvas, and map those
positions onto the physical screen. To keep gameplay timing and movement
close, regardless of the different sizes and speeds of phone it will run
on, frame-rate independent code works best.

`libcrtxy` puts these concepts together into a light `API` on top of `libSDL`.

== Goal

My goals for `libcrtxy` are:

* Don't care about CPU or FPU — be fast, encourage framerate
independence, and encourage use of fixed-point math.
* Scale — screen size shouldn't matter to a vector-based game, since
vectors scale. A game should play, more-or-less, the same on a 2GHz PC
with an Nvidia graphics card as it does on a 200MHz ARM-based handheld
with a 320x240 screen.
* Look like an arcade game — on systems with the horsepower, it should
be possible for a game to look a lot like a real arcade CRT with glowing
phosphors. (On systems that don't, degrade to pixelated lines.)
* Developers of games don't decide the rendering level — *it's up to the
user* (or the person packaging the game, say for some particular
handheld game system or embedded platform) to decide how "nice" the game
should look.
** Environment variables
** Config. files
** Command-line options
* Open source license — `libcrtxy` is released under the
http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html[GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL)&#44; version 2.1]. This means you may use
it in both open source and commercial games.


== Screenshots

Below are some screenshots of the test programs that come with
`libcrtxy` 's source. When comparing two renders, remember that the game
was not recompiled. `libcrtxy` itself was given a different set of options
— via the library's configuration file, via command-line options to the
app. which were then passed to the library, and/or via environment
variable.

You can browse the documentation (generated with 'doxygen') via the web
interface to the CVS repository:

== Help Me!

I'm looking for help implementing all of the neat things I'd like
libcrtxy to do! Know OpenGL and SDL? Can you build library DLLs for
Windows? Etc.!
